        <p class='lang-en'>Hello, I'm Kenta, a Filipino-Japanese Web Developer based in Yokohama, Japan. Fluent in both English and Japanese (JLPT N2), I've embarked on an exciting journey of career change.</p>
        <p class='lang-en'>After contemplating a career switch, I persevered and took the next big step in my life. I made the bold decision to join one of the world's most prestigious programming bootcamps, Le Wagon Tokyo. There, I recently graduated and acquired web development skills, specializing in Ruby on Rails, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and PostgreSQL. However, my hunger for knowledge continues, and I'm always eager to learn more.</p>
        <p class='lang-en'>Driven by my passion for web development, I'm thrilled to explore new opportunities in the field. I firmly believe that each project offers a chance to learn and grow, and I approach them with unwavering enthusiasm and dedication.</p>
        <p class='lang-en'>During my free time, you can find me at the skatepark or hitting the gym, indulging in activities that rejuvenate my spirit. 🛹🏋🏻</p>
